# CONMATIA
Controlled Automation using Bluetooth and  motion Detector

The project aims to replace conventional switches by the two-way controlled switch i.e., 
Mechanical and voice controlled. Motion detection which when implemented, enhances 
automation and hence energy conservation. A Bluetooth module HC-05 is interfaced with 
Arduino UNO microcontroller along with the motion detector circuit which is designed by 
us. The motion detector circuit ensures that no people are inside the room and switches off all 
the devices except those that are marked by the user. We are trying to create an easier interface 
so as to make it feasible for long distance control and a better alternative to manual control. 
The basic purpose of a conventional switch is to save power whenever the device is not in use. 
But the recent study says that this very basic purpose of the switch is not served. This demands 
an alternative controlling device such as AI induced home automation which can effectively 
conserve power. There by making our home or a industry much smarter than before.
